# FAO-crop-alternate-bearing
Data and annotated R code for Garcia et al. (in press), "By wind or wing: Pollination syndromes and alternate bearing in horticultural systems."
Please see the manuscript text for the background and context of this analysis. 

The data file "GG-FAOSTAT_AB_crops.csv" contains the selected data on perennial alternate-bearing crops from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2020. FAOSTAT Statistical Database: Crops. [Rome]. http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC. Visited Oct 2020.
The data file "Polllination and Alternate Bearing in crops - GG_ABcrops.csv" contains information on the pollination syndrome of each crop.
The data file "crop_phylo_for_r.csv" contains the family and species of each crop to make the phylogeny. 

The annotated R code is available to reproduce all analyses and figures. 
First run the code in "2021-04-29-Public-FAOSTAT_AB_timeseries-loop.R".
Then run the code in "2021-04-29-Public-FAO_AB_phylogenetic-loop.R"
